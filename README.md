### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm Jadesola and I am a prospective Computer Scientist based in the United Kingdom. My main language is Python but I am also familiar
with  the main Web Technologies langauges (HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript). My main interests are in routing algorithms and natural language processing, particularly for underrepresented languages with limited text resources as well as animation/graphics engineering. I am currently learning C++ in order to help build a resume for internship opportunities in animation.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a movie recommendation algorithm for my A Level NEA project.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning json and HTTP methods
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on entry-level NLP projects
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can converse in three languages! (English, Yoruba and Spanish)
